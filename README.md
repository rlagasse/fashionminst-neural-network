# FashionMNIST Neural Networks (PyTorch)

This repo contains implementations of a neural network classifier and a Siamese Network trained on [FashionMNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_MNIST) using PyTorch. This project was completed as part of a course assignment

This project was originally completed as part of CMPT 410 at Simon Fraser University in Spring 2025 under instructor Ke Li.

It is shared here as a personal project for portfolio purposes.
